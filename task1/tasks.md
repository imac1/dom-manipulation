1. Selecting and Manipulating Elements

- Select the first paragraph on the page and change its text color to blue.
- Select all elements with the class `myClass` and add a border around them.
- Create a new <p> element, set its text content to "This is a new paragraph", and append it to the end of the body.
- Remove the last child element of the `container` div.
- Select the last li element in the `myList` and change its text to "grapefruit".
- Select all elements with the class `myClass` and remove the first one.
- Create a new h2 element with the text "New Heading" and insert it before the first paragraph on the page.
- Wrap all elements with the class `myClass` in a new div with the class "container".
- Find the closest ancestor element with the class "container" for a given element.

2. Event Handling

- Add a click event listener to a button. 
- When clicked, change the background color of the body.
- Create a text input field. As the user types, display the number of characters they have typed in a span element.
- Add a mouseover event listener to all li elements. When the mouse hovers over an element, change its background color to green.
- Create a form with a text input and a submit button. When the form is submitted, prevent the default action and display an alert with the value of the input field.
- Implement a simple countdown timer that displays the remaining seconds in a span element.
- Create a toggle button that switches between showing and hiding a hidden element.

3. Creating and Modifying the DOM

- Create a simple unordered list with 5 items. Each item should have a different background color.
- Clone an existing element and append the clone to the end of the parent element.
- Wrap all paragraphs on the page in a new div element.
- Create a table with 3 rows and 3 columns. Populate the table with data.
- Clone the entire `myList` and append the clone to the end of the body.
- Create a new nav element and insert it at the beginning of the body.

4. Traversing the DOM

- Find the parent element of the `specPar` element.
- Get the next sibling of the paragraph element with the text "first p".
- Count the number of child elements of the `myList` element.
- Find the previous sibling of the myButton element.
- Count the number of p elements on the page.
